# My personal website

This was made using stenciljs !

## Getting Started

Check out https://github.com/ionic-team/stencil-starter for a clean starter.

To toy around with this website, clone this repo to a new directory:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:machour/machour.idk.tn.git my-app
cd my-app
git remote rm origin
```

and run:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

To view the build, start an HTTP server inside of the `/www` directory.

To watch for file changes during develop, run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

To build the app for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```
